              We'll make it easy for you: If you pay monthly, you can also
              cancel monthly. (Monthly payments are possible in our Lite, Pro,
              and Business plans.) If you take advantage of the semi-annual
              payment, you can cancel semi-annually. This means that you can
              cancel an annual payment with all its benefits every year.

              <strong>What does termination mean?</strong> Termination means
              that your contract will not automatically be renewed for the same
              period at the end of the current billing period. In the event of
              termination, the current billing period can, of course, be used in
              full until the end. A proportional repayment of the current
              billing period is not possible.

              Your account will be automatically reduced to the free plan at the
              end of the current, already paid billing period. All your
              galleries and files will of course remain. Existing galleries and
              files that exceed the maximum of 3 galleries or the 1 GB storage
              of the free plan are no longer available for third parties and
              cannot be downloaded anymore.
